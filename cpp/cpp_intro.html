        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>What is C++?</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">C++ is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in a variety of applications, including game development, embedded systems, web development, high-performance computing, and machine learning. C++ is a powerful and efficient language that offers a wide range of features, including object-oriented programming, generics, and memory management.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>History of C++</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. Stroustrup&#39;s goal was to create a language that was as powerful and efficient as C, but that also offered the benefits of object-oriented programming. The first version of C++ was released in 1985, and the language has continued to evolve over the years.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Features of C++</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">C++ is a general-purpose programming language, which means that it can be used to develop a wide variety of applications. C++ is also a statically typed language, which means that the data types of variables must be known at compile time. This helps to prevent errors and makes the code more efficient.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Some of the key features of C++ include:</span></span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Setting up a C++ development environment</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">To set up a C++ development environment, you will need to install a C++ compiler and a code editor. There are many different C++ compilers and code editors available, so you can choose the ones that best suit your needs.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Once you have installed a C++ compiler and a code editor, you can start writing and compiling C++ programs. To compile a C++ program, you will need to use the C++ compiler. The compiler will generate an executable file that you can run.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>C++ basics</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">The C++ basics include syntax, variables, data types, operators, control statements, functions, and classes.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Syntax</strong> is the set of rules that define how C++ code is written. C++ syntax is similar to the syntax of other programming languages, such as C and Java.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Variables</strong> are used to store data. Variables can be declared with different data types, such as int, float, and char.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Data types</strong> specify the type of data that a variable can store. For example, the int data type can store integers, and the float data type can store floating-point numbers.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Operators</strong> are used to perform operations on data. For example, the + operator is used to add two numbers, and the - operator is used to subtract two numbers.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Control statements</strong> are used to control the flow of a program. For example, the if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Functions</strong> are used to group code together and to reuse code. Functions can take parameters and can return values.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Classes</strong> are used to create reusable and maintainable code. Classes can contain data members and member functions.</span></span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>What is object-oriented programming?</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs. Object-oriented programming is a powerful and flexible way to design and develop software.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>OOP concepts in C++</strong></span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">The key concepts of object-oriented programming in C++ are classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Classes</strong> are used to create blueprints for objects. Classes can contain data members and member functions.</span></span></span></p>
        
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"><strong>Objects</strong> are instances of classes. Objects can contain data members and can call member</span></span></span></p>
