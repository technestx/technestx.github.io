            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

            <li><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Object-oriented:</span></span></strong></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"> C# is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects. Objects are self-contained units of code that encapsulate data and behavior. This makes C# code modular and reusable.</span></span></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Type-safe:</span></span></strong></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"> C# is a type-safe programming language, which means that the compiler checks for type errors at compile time. This helps to prevent runtime errors and makes C# code more reliable.</span></span></span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f">Garbage collected:</span></span></strong></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#1f1f1f"> C# is a garbage-collected programming language, which means that the system automatically manages the allocation and deallocation of memory. This takes the burden of memory management off of the programmer.</span></span></span></li>
